	In case you think 'wait, is this really for rehearsal or is this for cheating?', yes, this website
	is supposed to help you cheat linkedin tests. It's completely ethical to cheat stupid linkedin
	tests so you can add a stupid badge in your stupid linkedin profile that rude and shameless
	employers won't probably even give a fuck about. Bill Gates stole everything he supposedly own
	including the stupid linkedin itself. So did every capitalist piece of shit. So did your
	employers. They should be ashamed to death just for being alive as such selfish bastards. But you
	shouldn't feel guilty for cheating stupid tests. You're good. Nothing is wrong with cheating
	stupid tests just so you can be a slave to rich bastards that stole everything from the innocent.
	Maybe I'll make a browser plugin later so you don't have to fill stupid answers just to get a
	stupid badge. Maybe not. Who cares?
